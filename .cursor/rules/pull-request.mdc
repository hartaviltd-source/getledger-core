## Pull request title

- Write PR titles in **English**.
- Start the title with a **capital letter**.
- Use **present tense** and keep it concise (ideally <= 72 chars).
- Avoid a trailing period.

### Examples

- `Improve markdown table overflow handling`
- `Clarify contributing branch naming`
- `Add onboarding stepper page`

## Pull request description

- Write PR descriptions in **English**.
- Focus on **why** the change is needed and what user-visible effect it has.
- Keep it skimmable: bullets, short paragraphs, clear headings.

### Recommended template

```md
## Summary
- <1–3 bullets describing the change and why>

## Changes
- <key implementation notes, non-obvious decisions>
```

### Notes

- If you changed SCSS or any package behavior, add a **changeset** describing it (one sentence, with backticks for code elements).
- If a PR is WIP, mark it as draft and prefix the title with `WIP:` only while it is not ready for review.
